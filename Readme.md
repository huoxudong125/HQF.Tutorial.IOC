###Unity
The Unity Container (Unity) is a lightweight, extensible dependency injection container. It facilitates building loosely coupled applications and provides developers with the following advantages:

 - Simplified object creation, especially for hierarchical object structures and dependencies
 - Abstraction of requirements; this allows developers to specify dependencies at run time or in configuration and simplify management of crosscutting concerns
 - Increased flexibility by deferring component configuration to the container
 - Service location capability; this allows clients to store or cache the container
 - Instance and type interception
 - Registration by convention
